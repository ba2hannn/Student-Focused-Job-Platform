This project is an ASP.NET MVC-based website designed to help students find jobs. The site features a variety of features, including automatic CV creation, employer and student logins, messaging, adding favorite ads, viewing ads and applying for jobs. Employers can use the site to review student portfolios to find suitable candidates. The entire project is designed with the Code First approach and uses the MySQL database.

The site's intelligent algorithm filters job opportunities based on students' university information, including their major and year of study. This ensures that students only see relevant job postings that align with their academic background and skillset. For instance, if an employer posts a job requiring expertise in information technology, and a student is enrolled in a related major but is currently in their second year, the job opportunity will not appear on the "Job Opportunities" page. However, once the student progresses to their fourth year, the job posting will automatically be added to the "Job Opportunities" page. This dynamic matching system ensures that students are presented with opportunities that match their current qualifications and academic progress.

Additionally, the site automatically calculates students' experience based on their education and skills, allowing them to filter job searches based on their level of expertise. This feature empowers students to find positions that align with their capabilities and career aspirations.

The "Job Postings" page provides comprehensive access to all job listings on the site, including detailed descriptions, requirements, and application instructions.

Students can save their favorite job postings for easy reference and future applications using the "Favorite Postings" tab.

The "Messages" tab facilitates direct communication between students and employers. Students can initiate conversations with potential employers, send inquiries, and maintain a record of past interactions.

Overall, the site's intelligent filtering, automated experience calculation, and user-friendly messaging system empower students to navigate the job market effectively and connect with potential employers.

Here is a more concise translation:

Smart job filtering based on university info (major, year). Students only see relevant jobs. Experience auto-calculated for job filtering. Full job details on "Job Postings" page. Save favorites. Message employers via "Messages" tab.
